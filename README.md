# Program
Program for Group Project in CS4323 @ OSU

When the program starts, a list of process' and their arrival times, burst times, and priority is displayed for each scheduling technique.
We use Round Robin and Multilevel Queue scheduling schemes to schedule these process'.
You can change the time quantum for either, by using the '+' and '-' buttons on the left.
Press the calculate button to see the gannt chart, average turnaround and the average waiting time of the process list.
Reset button will clear the gannt chart and average data.
